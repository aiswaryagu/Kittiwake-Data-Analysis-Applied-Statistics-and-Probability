# Kittiwake-Data-Analysis-Applied-Statistics-and-Probability

This project involves analyzing datasets provided by an ornithologist studying two sub-species of kittiwakes (black-legged and red-legged). The analysis addresses questions on kittiwake sightings, breeding trends, physical measurements, and environmental factors affecting breeding colonies.

## Objectives

Observation Data: Conduct exploratory analysis and construct an 80% confidence interval for dawn sightings.

Historical Data: Test the hypothesis of site-independent population decline and estimate breeding pairs at Site C in 2009.

Measurement Data: Provide a visual summary, test wing span and culmen independence within sub-species, compare weights, and analyze differences between sub-species.

Location Data: Fit linear models to predict breeding pairs, assess covariate effects, and provide an 80% confidence interval for specific environmental conditions.

### Files Included

Analysis Code: An RMarkdown (.Rmd) file that performs the full analysis as described, including statistical tests, model fitting, and data visualization.

Note: Only the .Rmd file is included in this repository.
